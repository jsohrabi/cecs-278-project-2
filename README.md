# cecs-278-project-2
This was my submission for Project 2 of my Object Oriented Application Development class. The goal of this assignment was to create a rock-paper-scissors game with a simple built-in AI opponent with Java.

Some template code was provided the professor of the course, Shannon Cleary.
